# Explore-Critique-Implement

Separate exploration, authoritative critique, implementation, and independent review. The builder never critiques its own output.

## Activation and invariants

Start only when CODEX selects ECI or active ATE explicitly routes bounded work through it. Loading this router alone does not start ECI. Use ECI for non-mechanical work with uncertainty, future behavior/routing/protocol risk, or two plausible approaches; classify by decision complexity and risk, not diff size. A one-line/local change is still non-trivial when it changes instructions, prompts, routing, protocols, public contracts, security, persistence, concurrency, architecture, or reviewer/agent behavior. Skip only a mechanical answer whose consequences are obvious, directly verifiable, and carry no future behavior or routing risk.

- Maintain requirement lineage and a project-understanding ledger. The active ECI/ATE lifecycle owns normal work; ATE may contain normal ECI. Keep forecast values in `forecasts.md`; project-understanding may link to it but must not duplicate them.
- Apply [concurrent task scheduling](../../CODEX.md#concurrent-tasks) to new Jobs, independent progress, outcome-local gates, and root closure. Each outcome keeps its scope and Producer identities; ownership follows the [Job Orchestrator contract](references/task-orchestrator.md).
- For material ECI work, keep `exact user source → faithful requested outcome →
  bounded scope`. A repair necessary to meet or prove that outcome stays current-lane work.
  For each already-discovered lower-priority code issue that remains unfixed, add the TODO defined by [Main ECI quality responsibility](references/fast-path.md#main-eci-quality-responsibility). It does not change an in-scope disposition or replace its required repair; for a separate-outcome issue, its TODO is the only code edit and the issue remains post-ECI.
  Missing or stale lineage never blocks known in-scope work.
- Every admitted outcome starts main-path ECI and one [Fast Owner](references/fast-path.md) concurrently within its home Job. That module owns launch, lifetime, shared-tree priority, evidence feedback, adoption, and closure rules.
- Follow the normative [post-Fast completion sequence](references/fast-path.md#post-fast-completion).
- Intermediate iteration progress remains concurrent.
- Record `Stage: normal` for ECI; show main-path and Fast progress within each outcome, not as separate stages or automatic lanes.
- A lane is an independently advancing workstream, not an ECI step. Serial implement→review→repair→review→implement stays one lane with one critical path. Create distinct lanes only for independently advancing work with separate ownership or synchronization.
- Every normal ECI Worker reads this router plus the exact module(s) useful to its assignment. Report an unknown role, predicate, or link to the Supervisor and resolve it while safe bounded assigned work continues; it does not itself deny or stall normal work.
- Own your assigned outcome through successful completion, required evidence, and complete handoff. Resolve recoverable obstacles with safe, authorized in-scope actions; use and verify available recovery paths before asking for help (for example, use authorized ADB recovery to unlock the task device). If no authorized in-scope path is available, or attempted recovery leaves the outcome blocked, report why, what you tried (where possible), and the exact missing input, access, or approval. Keep scope bounded; the Supervisor retains ECI lifecycle and final acceptance.
- The Supervisor alone loads lifecycle, blocker, pause, stop, teardown, and pressure-policy modules. The current Job owner—an Orchestrator when J > 1, the Supervisor when J ≤ 1—loads shared [review policy](../references/workflow-runtime/review-policy.md) only for outcome-level review dispatch and evidence coordination under the [Job Orchestrator contract](references/task-orchestrator.md). It sends findings, evidence, and disposition recommendations to the Supervisor. The Supervisor retains final adjudication, commit-range verification, acceptance, and protected operations.
- Each normal iteration is Explore → Critique → Implement → parallel Review. A producer never acts as critic.
- Main-path bugs with hard uncertainty or a material competing diagnosis/approach use `debugging-discipline`; the Fast Owner Producer follows its assigned module.

## Configuration E2E contract

Every configuration change, including configuration-only work, requires the final implementer-owned and fresh independent E2E pair on the stabilized final cumulative state described below. This requirement may not be waived.

## Runtime E2E policy

Code/debug work affecting runtime behavior reachable through a UI, API, device, or CLI requires the final E2E pair below. Docs, prompts, design-only changes, tests-only changes, and pure refactors do not require E2E under this policy.

## E2E cadence, scope, and timing

Each implementation iteration still gets focused tests/proof, a checked scoped Producer commit during handoff, independent Supervisor verification of its immutable range, and independent code review. Do not run routine E2E between iterations. An early E2E is allowed only to investigate a concrete failure or integration uncertainty; run the shortest faithful real-path scenario that can resolve it. Early evidence does not replace final E2E.

For active ECI, this router controls E2E applicability and cadence within ECI iterations. `testing-discipline` still governs focused-check and required-E2E quality, but its generic per-modification E2E default does not add routine E2E between ECI iterations. This ECI-local cadence does not replace separately applicable outer-workflow acceptance evidence, such as ATE root gates.

Once main-path implementation, post-Fast findings/dispositions, and any resulting repairs are complete, run one final pair before acceptance whenever a configuration or runtime trigger applies: the Implementer Producer’s E2E and a fresh independent Step 4 E2E on the same stabilized final cumulative revision. The independent run may repeat or extend the Producer’s run. A later material edit affecting exercised behavior, assertions, or configuration invalidates the affected E2E evidence; refresh it before acceptance.

Use the shortest faithful real path that proves the original criteria and checks relevant regressions. Run the full suite only when it supplies coverage required for that proof. Cite the command and actual output/state/screenshot; proxy evidence alone is insufficient.

Every early, Fast, Producer-final, and independent-final E2E report records `started_at_utc` and `finished_at_utc` (RFC 3339 UTC), `elapsed_monotonic_seconds`, command, scope/coverage, tested revision, and environment identity sufficient for comparison (runner/host class, OS/architecture, relevant tool/runtime versions, and test-service/data configuration). Redact secrets. Compare duration only for matching commands and scope/coverage in materially equivalent environments; do not rerun solely to collect timing. A comparable material regression beyond ordinary variance triggers the Fast Owner Producer or a bounded Helper to profile and optimize E2E duration in parallel while main-path ECI continues. Preserve assertions, coverage, real-path evidence, and the independent final E2E.

## Model selection

At each new spawn, read `~/.codex/model-selection.yaml` and pass both `model` and `reasoning_effort` explicitly with `fork_turns: "none"`. Keep existing launch settings and reusable owners. If a new activity needs another profile, assign a correctly configured helper. Keep independent reviewer assignments self-contained and blind to producer findings. If a requested model or selector is unavailable, record the limitation and continue with the available provider. Treat the file as a routing reference; do not assume native auto-loading or effective-model telemetry. Profile selection does not change role authority or reviewer independence.

Choose by assigned activity; mixed assignments use the highest applicable profile.

| Profile | Activities |
| --- | --- |
| `max` | Solution design; unresolved RCA work; design review, including Step 2; long-term health review, including Critic C. |
| `higher` | Other independent reviews, including Critics A/B, settled RCA review, and independent Step 4 E2E. |
| `default` | Implementation; routine work; producer E2E. |

## Module routing

Supervisor routes begin with [coordinator runtime](../references/workflow-runtime/coordinator-runtime.md). Use [coding-style admission](../references/workflow-runtime/coding-style-admission.md) only for governed writing/admission, [review policy](../references/workflow-runtime/review-policy.md) only for review/impact routing, [pause-all-work](../references/workflow-runtime/pause-all-work.md) only for its exact direct-user predicate, [stop recovery](../references/workflow-runtime/stop-recovery.md) only for recognized Stop diagnostics, and [policy pressure tests](../references/workflow-runtime/policy-pressure-tests.md) only for workflow-policy changes.

| Role | Required module | Conditional module/predicate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supervisor | [coordinator](references/coordinator.md), [coordinator runtime](../references/workflow-runtime/coordinator-runtime.md), [review policy](../references/workflow-runtime/review-policy.md) | [pause-all-work](../references/workflow-runtime/pause-all-work.md), [stop recovery](../references/workflow-runtime/stop-recovery.md), and [policy pressure tests](../references/workflow-runtime/policy-pressure-tests.md) only by their predicates |
| `explorer` | [explore](references/explore.md) | [debugging-discipline](../debugging-discipline/SKILL.md) only for assigned bug investigation; [coding-style admission](../references/workflow-runtime/coding-style-admission.md) only for assigned governed source discovery |
| `critic-step2` | [critique](references/critique.md) | [coding-style admission](../references/workflow-runtime/coding-style-admission.md) only for independent admission |
| Producer (`implementer`) | [implement](references/implement.md) | [debugging-discipline](../debugging-discipline/SKILL.md) only for assigned code/debug work; [coding-style admission](../references/workflow-runtime/coding-style-admission.md) only for a governed scope |
| Orchestrator | [task-orchestrator](references/task-orchestrator.md) | Candidate, handoff, or relay by bounded assignment; Job dispatch only after the Supervisor publishes ownership; shared [review policy](../references/workflow-runtime/review-policy.md) only for outcome-level review/evidence |
| `fast-owner` (Fast Owner Producer) | [ECI fast path](references/fast-path.md) | Early E2E only under [E2E cadence, scope, and timing](#e2e-cadence-scope-and-timing) |
| Critic A/B/C, E2E | [review](references/review.md) | [coding-style admission](../references/workflow-runtime/coding-style-admission.md) only for reviewed governed scope; E2E follows [E2E cadence, scope, and timing](#e2e-cadence-scope-and-timing). |

## Step handoffs

1. Explorer ranks tagged, evidence-backed options and required PoC/style-source proposal.
2. The current Job owner dispatches a fresh Step 2 critic for the outcome. The critic independently baselines, admits scope, rejects bad options, and selects concrete winner text or returns bounded re-exploration.
3. The assigned Implementer Producer applies only the winner and `treatment: now` corrections with causal/proof evidence, then commits its checked scope during handoff.
Before Step 4 or dependent work on another implementation iteration, the Supervisor independently verifies the Producer’s immutable parent-to-commit range. Reviewers receive that range and explicit exclusions; excluded baseline and later ambient changes remain outside review scope.
4. The current Job owner dispatches fresh A/B/C critics in parallel for every outcome iteration and fresh independent E2E when required; E2E follows [E2E cadence, scope, and timing](#e2e-cadence-scope-and-timing). The Supervisor retains final impact/treatment/disposition adjudication and acceptance. Substantive findings return as one design batch; contained fixes return once to implementation. Clean pass needs every original criterion, required proof, and no remaining `now` issue.

## Relationship to other skills

| Skill | Relationship |
| --- | --- |
| `brainstorming` | Explores user intent before design; ECI explores solutions after intent is clear. |
| `agent-teams-execution` | Starts only on explicit user request; once active, may route bounded work through ECI. Re-spawn an ECI critic that cites no issues beyond producer self-reports. |
| `blocker-resolution-protocol` | Supplies shared blocker records and escalation rules. ECI retains role separation, loop-breaker, and hard-escalation semantics. |
| `debugging-discipline` | Diagnoses known bugs; ECI explores open-ended improvement/design. |

## Red flags

- A worker loads coordinator/blocker/pause/stop/teardown/review-runtime/pressure policy without explicit assignment.
- A producer reviews itself, a blind critic reuses context, or review critics run sequentially.
- A substantive gate finding is patched directly instead of returning through Explore/Critique.
- A marker is removed to bypass routing or acceptance.
